# Vertical-aeroponics-home-farm
DIY aeroponics vertical farm for growing any plants such as tomato, cucumber, strawberry etc. at home.

This project is simple aeroponics stillage with low pressure (2.5 atm and lower) and big nozzles (1 mm), which is supplied by windshield washer pump through 4/7 mm irrigation pipe.
